# SSH Discord bot
A Discord bot that you use to issue commands on a Linux server... I guess?

⚠️ I don't actually recommend using this for security purposes but if you want to, go for it; I made it because I got bored. 

*Code is all tested but I won't be providing updates or suppport for this. Some code was modified by GPT 4.0.*
